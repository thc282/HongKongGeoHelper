# Hong Kong Geo Helper
This application is developed by flutter

## Project Background
The aim of this project is to create an Android app that provides users with the ability to search for locations based on various options. Currently, there are limited apps available with this functionality, and existing options often lack complete features, such as the inability to jump to the map view or the absence of comprehensive search options.
